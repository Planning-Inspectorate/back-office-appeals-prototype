{% set dummydod = 'The proposed development comprises the construction of 120 new residential dwellings on a 10-hectare site located on the outskirts of the town centre. The scheme includes a mix of detached, semi-detached, and terraced houses, alongside low-rise apartment blocks, designed to accommodate a range of household sizes and needs. The development will be phased over three years and will incorporate sustainable building practices, including energy-efficient materials, solar panel installations, and rainwater harvesting systems.

Key features of the proposal include:

A central green space with pedestrian pathways and recreational areas.
Integration with existing transport infrastructure, including new bus stops and cycle lanes.
Affordable housing provision, with 30% of units designated for shared ownership or social rent.
Environmental impact mitigation measures, such as tree planting and biodiversity corridors.' %}
